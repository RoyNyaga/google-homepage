This project is all about building the google homepage user interface and it focuses more on the html tags and css styles involved in it. It is not exactly the same since the javascript aspect of it is omitted and just the css and html taken into consideration. Throughout this project, i had a detailed understanding of the following:
How navigation bars are built using inline-block list.
How to style and include images in an html page and usd as logos and icons.
How to use css to style attributes of divs.
How to use an external css stylesheet and reference it in an html page.
How to use git and github.
